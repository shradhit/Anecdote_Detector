What’s in it for me? Find out how to take control of your life and live up to your potential.Do you want to change your life but find it hard to commit to your decisions? As you go through life, do you tend to believe that the cards are somehow stacked against you? In Awaken The Giant Within, you’ll learn just how important decisions and beliefs are to bringing about positive change and becoming the person you want to be. With characteristic insight and clarity, motivational speaker Anthony Robbins demonstrates the control that each of us holds over our experience of the world, and therefore over our happiness. In the following blinks you will find out why singing can help you quit eating chocolate; learn that the words you use to describe your situation can define your attitude toward life; and discover that you have the power to change society, simply by making the right dinner choice. To change your life, focus on making and committing to the right decisions.When was the last time you thought about changing your life? Perhaps it was New Year's Eve and you resolved to quit smoking. Or maybe you wanted to lose weight and seriously considered going on a new diet. But did you actually manage to bring about those changes to your life? If you didn’t, the problem was likely in how you framed your desire to change: “I’d like to stop eating junk food” instead of “I will start eating more healthily.” To change anything about your life, you first have to make a clear decision. Then, no matter what challenges you may face, you have to stick to that decision. This necessitates that you must be willing to adapt your approach as you meet obstacles. And while committing to major decisions may be challenging, the more you do it, the easier it becomes. So, when you inevitably fail as you try to enact a change in your life, don’t be discouraged. Instead, think about what you could learn from the failure. For example, Make new habits by associating unwanted ones with pain and desired ones with pleasure.We’ve seen that to accomplish our goals and bring about change we must fully commit to our decisions. But even with the best of intentions, changing our established behavior can sometimes be extremely difficult. Why? Because everything we do is in the service of either getting pleasure or avoiding pain. Once you make yourself aware of this dynamic, you can begin to use it to your advantage. So, if you want to break a particular habit, an effective method for doing so is to associate that behavior with pain. This technique has a proven track record for helping people break even quite extreme habits. To change who you are, change your beliefs.Imagine two people that just turned 60. One of them might think his life is coming to an end, now that his best years are gone. The other, however, might be truly thrilled for everything that’s still in store for her. What could account for such a striking difference in outlook? The way that we see the world and ourselves is shaped by our beliefs. But what exactly is a belief? A belief is an idea that’s supported by evidence. You might, for example, have the idea that you’re an excellent chess player. But that idea will become a belief only if it’s supported by certain evidence, for example, you win the majority of the time. For most of us, any events in our lives can act as a reference and inform our beliefs. Unfortunately, this also means that whenever something awful happens – for example, you lose a loved one – many people use it as support for their belief that life is terrible. But we don’t have to think that way: if we manage to interpret the reference more positively, we can direct our lives in a more optimistic way. So, if you’re grieving, you could use that experience as a resource to make you stronger as a person. Perhaps you’ll even emerge from the grieving period with a strong desire to help others in mourning. As this suggests, to bring about a change in your life, you must first change your beliefs. The problem, however, is that many of us tend to already have strong beliefs that hold us back from changing anything. Habitual beliefs, like all habits, can be broken. As with any other habit, to change an existing belief, you need to associate pain with the old one and pleasure with the new. An easy way to accomplish that is to find a role model who has already been successful in changing her beliefs, and adapt her way of doing it to your own purposes.Changing your vocabulary can transform your attitudes and emotions.Did you know that in the English language there are approximately 3000 words that describe emotions? Surprisingly, however, there are nearly twice as many words for negative emotions as for positive ones – which could be a reason why many people tend to experience negative emotions more frequently. It’s therefore crucial that you pay close attention to the words you use in your daily life, as they will shape your thinking and perception. A final tip: To find the best solution to any problem, ask the right questions.As you’ve learned, changing your life requires changing the way you think. In this blink we’ll venture a little deeper to ask, what exactly is thinking? In basic terms, our thoughts are a series of questions and answers. Thus, the questions we ask determine the way that we think, which means that those questions are essential to our experience of life. It follows, then, that the quality of our questions has a massive impact on the quality of our lives. Every time you ask a question, its quality will determine the focus of your thoughts. If you ask a negative question, you'll get a negative answer; ask a positive question, and you’ll get a positive answer. For example, Discover your own life values to find out if you’re living up to your full potential.Can you say with certainty what you believe is most important to your life? Is it love? Your health? If you’re not sure, you should endeavor to find out, as the most successful, happiest people are those who understand their own values and live their lives accordingly. So if you don’t feel fulfilled in your life but don’t know exactly why that is, it could be that you’re not living in accordance with your beliefs. Imagine you’re offered an exciting new job in a different country. Accepting that offer means you’ll have to uproot your life and move your family thousands of miles. Would you be willing? If you can’t decide, the reason is that you’re uncertain of your values. In this particular case, to make a decision that will bring you happiness you first need to find out whether personal growth is more important to you than financial security. Make time to reflect on and list your most important values in order of priority, and elaborate on your reasons for including those values. In making this list, you might notice that some of the values you currently hold are not well-suited to accomplishing your goals. Perhaps your ultimate value in life is passion – everything you do, you want to do it with a lot of passion. But, as you reflect on the alignment of your values and goals, you might realize that approaching everything with passion causes your health to suffer. This is an unsuitable value, because if you’re unwell, you won’t be able to approach anything with passion. The solution here is to change your values. You could decide that, from now on, you should prioritize your health over your passion. By putting health first you will be able to be passionate without the drawbacks.Come up with life rules that make you happy, and tell others about them.All of us have rules we follow in our lives. These rules, like, “I’ll be happy once I get to eat that Snickers,” play a large part in determining both our actions and how we feel because they decide what will and won’t make us happy. However, such rules can actually limit our experience, and thus the odds of us achieving true happiness. Think about yourself for a moment: What do you need to happen for you to be happy? Do you need to win the lottery? Do you want your friends to appreciate you more? While you may be correct that such things will bring you happiness, those things are beyond your control. Therefore, it’s important to establish life rules that you can control. For example, instead of the rule “I’ll feel great only if someone congratulates me on my work,” try employing a rule that makes your happiness dependent on accomplishing personal goals. By understanding what’s behind your emotions, you can gain control over them.We’ve seen that by being less stringent about your own rules, you can decide what will make you happy. But it’s not just happiness you can gain mastery over; you can, in fact, choose your entire range of emotions. But in order to gain that control, we need to first identify our true emotions. We tend to get easily overwhelmed by our negative emotions, usually because we generalize them or fail to identify them correctly. For instance, you might be feeling angry about something, but, if you reflect on the true cause of your emotional pain, you might realize there’s something else behind that anger, maybe exhaustion. As soon as you’ve identified this cause, you can use Transformational Vocabulary (influencing your emotions by describing them differently) and express your exhaustion by saying “I’m feeling a little droopy.” This will diminish any negativity you feel, and make the emotion easier to overcome. It’s also important to ensure that you don’t view your more difficult emotions in a negative way. All emotions can help you to enact positive change in your life, as they indicate that something’s not quite right, prompting you to examine them to find the true cause of your difficulties. Only by identifying that cause can you begin to change. But understanding the cause of a particular emotion is just the first step. The next step is a bigger challenge: you have to take action to deal with the emotion and change whatever it is that’s causing it. So, if you successfully identified the cause of your unhappy emotion as loneliness, you can begin to search for the reasons that you’re lonely. For instance, it may be that you haven’t reached out to any of your friends lately. If that’s the case, the solution is clear: take action and call them. Sometimes, though, you’ll feel that you simply cannot deal with a particular emotion. When that happens, try to recall a time when you dealt successfully with it. Doing this will give you confidence in your ability to handle difficult feelings, because if you’ve managed to deal with it once, you can certainly do it again.Contribute to society to discover what you can accomplish as an individual.In the previous blinks, we discussed how to take control of your life, achieve success and find happiness. At this point, however, you may be thinking that no matter the change you can make in your individual life, you’re never going to have the power to change anything in society. Fortunately, that’s not the case. Even the smallest decisions you make in your own life can have a major social influence. There’s another way you can bring about positive social change. Now that you’ve learned how to control and reflect on your own emotions, you could start helping others with theirs. Final summaryThe key message in this book: Even small decisions and changes in your behavior can have a huge influence on how you live your own life, and on society in general.

Think and Grow Rich details what he found.What’s in it for me? Follow the making of a legendary investor.Besides Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett is probably one of the best-known billionaires in the world. With his low-key profile and homegrown style – he does his own taxes and wears slightly shabby suits – the “Sage of Omaha” is a beloved man, even among those who tend to have little sympathy for the super wealthy. So who is Warren Buffett? That’s what you’ll learn in these blinks. We follow Buffett from growing up in Omaha, through his early days in trading, to his years as the richest man in the world. And we get a glimpse of the unique investment sense he showed throughout his business life. In these blinks, you’ll find out that Buffett made his first stock trade as a child; what investment philosophy has influenced all of Buffett’s investments; and why Berkshire Hathaway is the company most associated with Buffett. Warren Buffett grew up in the Midwestern city of Omaha, Nebraska. Money was often on his mind.Warren Edward Buffett was born to Howard and Leila Buffett on August 30, 1930, at a time when many families were facing an uncertain future. Even though his father’s business became successful when Warren was six, he never forgot those early Depression years. It wasn’t long before Warren’s interest in investment and entrepreneurship revealed itself. Warren was no slouch at school, either. He graduated in the top three percent and enrolled at the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce, in Pennsylvania, where his love of money would only grow.At Columbia Business School, Buffett met his mentor and began his investment career. Some of his early proposals were turned down as they were considered too risky, but, in the end, Buffett became a star employee. At the age of 26, Buffett returned to Nebraska and started his own business.Buffet was never in love with the hustle and bustle of New York City. Furthermore, he was now a father, and he wanted to raise his kids in the peaceful environment of Omaha. Once he returned to his hometown, Buffett began forming his own investment partnership, Buffett Associates, Ltd. Within a year, he’d raised $500,000 from friends and family, all of which he put to work by flawlessly applying Graham’s theories and investing in undervalued companies that steadily paid off. In that first year, he was so successful that his initial $500,000 portfolio increased in value by 10 percent. By the end of the third year, that value had actually doubled! Remarkably, all the while, this youngster in Nebraska was outperforming the Dow-Jones Industrial Average. Incredibly, at just 35 years of age, Buffett’s 1965 portfolio had grown to be worth $22 million, and his own net worth was at nearly $4 million.Buffett became involved with his now-famous company, Berkshire Hathaway, in 1962.In 1964, Buffett purchased controlling interest in Berkshire Hathaway, the company he is most closely associated with today. By 1969, Berkshire had become the main focus of his time and energy, and so he decided to dissolve the original Omaha partnership which, over the last 13 years, had increased exponentially in value – from half a million to $104 million. As chairman of the board at Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett continued to add new companies to its holding and, as a result, the price of Berkshire’s own shares went through the roof – increasing from $7.60 per share in 1962 to $95 per share in 1976! At this point Buffett was making quite a name for himself, and he was able to do something he always wanted to do – own a newspaper. In the 1970s, Berkshire became the largest outside shareholder of the Washington Post, the very newspaper Buffett had dropped on people’s doorsteps as a child. During this time, Buffett continued to pay himself his standard yearly salary of $50,000.Buffett’s wealth increased dramatically during the 1980s.In 1979, Buffett was still far outperforming the Dow-Jones Industrial Average; his own net worth was $140 million, and Berkshire was selling at $290 per share. His ability to make major investments, combined with the aggressive market of the 1980s, propelled Buffet to new levels of wealth. Despite his immense wealth, Buffett isn’t a stereotypical Wall Street billionaire.Throughout his life, Buffett has comfortably stayed in the modest house that he purchased for $31,500 when he was 27 years old. But that’s just the beginning of the many ways Buffett defies the billionaire stereotype. To begin with, As of 2015, his net worth was $64 billion, which makes his commitment to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation one of history’s greatest charitable donations – a legacy he can surely be proud of.Final summaryThe key message in this book: With the help of his mentor, Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett learned the important difference between how much a company is really worth and how much it’s selling for. An aptitude for discerning this difference, combined with a steadfast refusal to succumb to trends and a keen understanding of numbers, is what allowed Buffett to accrue a fortune exceeding $66 billion.

Suggested further reading: The Snowball by Alice Schroeder The Snowball (2008) offers a revealing look at the life and times of one of modern America’s most fascinating men: Warren Buffett. Find out how this shy and awkward man earned his first million dollars and how following a few fundamental rules enabled him to become the world’s wealthiest man. Motivation 1.0 and motivation 2.0: basic needs and the stick and the carrot.Around 50,000 years ago, man was preoccupied solely with his own survival – he was driven by motivation 1.0: the search for food and drink, a safe place to rest at night, and the desire to reproduce and pass on his genes. Up until a few centuries ago, these basic needs were the main driving force of humanity. By no later than the age of industrialization, however, this had begun to change. Production cycles became more complex, and man started to rely increasingly on a new impetus for production: extrinsic motivation 2.0, which is based on the two incentives of reward and punishment by a third party – also known as the stick and the carrot. The strategy behind this is that rewards reinforce desirable behavior. With the prospect of higher wages in mind, laborers haul more coal, and modern employees are quicker to respond to emails. Punishment, by contrast, is intended to prevent undesirable behavior. Someone rebuked in front of the whole team will be late less often, and a person threatened with dismissal for stealing materials is not likely to purloin anything from the workplace. Employers who rely on extrinsic motivation work on the premise that their workers, if not driven by the consequences of the stick and the carrot, fundamentally have no enthusiasm for their work and will try to shirk any responsibility; therefore, those in a management position must invariably direct and supervise them. Though it might be that some modern companies have relaxed the dress code or working hours for the sake of keeping their workers happy, Motivation 2.0 continues to dominate the working world. The managing parties of the majority of firms are convinced that when it comes to motivating their employees, the only important factor other than basic human needs is the use of rewards and sanctions – and they manage their workers accordingly. Motivation 1.0 and motivation 2.0: basic needs and the stick and the carrot.There is another way: Motivation 3.0 – intrinsic motivation in place of exterior incentives. In both the Rhesus monkeys and the Wikipedia example, motivation is not driven by basic needs, rewards or sanctions. How, then, can it be explained? There is another inner force that drives us: the intrinsic Motivation 3.0. When a person finds a job fulfilling, no further reward is necessary. Merely the joy of being able to program an application such as Firefox or to publish recipes on the internet for other people to benefit from is, frequently, motivation enough. Intrinsically motivated people want to be able to dictate when they work, what they work on, and what they are responsible for. They do not need to be directed or rewarded, because they enjoy working and do so voluntarily, without demanding anything in return. There is another way: Motivation 3.0 – intrinsic motivation in place of exterior incentives.Missing the target: the stick and the carrot can have harmful consequences. Although the stick and the carrot can be effective as incentives in the case of routine tasks, such as packing bags in a supermarket (where rewards drive employees to work more efficiently), if the work is more demanding or requires a greater degree of creativity, stick-and-carrot motivation can lead to immoral behavior and a decline in performance. Missing the target: the stick and the carrot can have harmful consequences.Extrinsic promises destroy intrinsic motivation. So what happens to their motivation? As children, we are driven by our inner desires to learn, to discover and to help others. But as we grow, we are programmed by our society to need extrinsic motivations: if we take out the trash, study hard and work tirelessly, we will be rewarded with friendly praise, high grades and good paychecks. Slowly, we lose more and more of our intrinsic motivation. On the path towards adulthood, our natural dedication decreases with age. Extrinsic promises destroy intrinsic motivation.Get into the flow: the inner drive for perfection leads to passion and dedication. Nevertheless, 50 percent of employees in the USA report feeling uncommitted to their job. They fulfill their duties but lack passion. This is because many are under-stretched in their work and have few opportunities for personal development. This suffocates their drive for perfection, which is important if one is to give 100 percent commitment. Creative people with a drive for perfection often work in a flow state, which means they pursue a task with the highest degree of concentration and passion, forget the world around them and lose themselves entirely in their work. Think of painters who happily work at their pictures for hours on end. The flow state cannot last for very extended periods, but it does occur episodically. It goes hand in hand with the drive for perfection, which continually develops and always leads to new states of ‘flow.’ Even tastes of success in an on-going piece of work, and the belief in continual improvement, are enough to motivate us in all different areas of life. Some people think that our skills are written in stone at birth, and that no amount of exertion will allow them to someday be better at running or drawing. These people are difficult to motivate. However, the person who believes they are able to develop further will work hard to run faster or paint prettier pictures. This also applies to employees, as long as they are entrusted with appropriate orders. While perfection is something we can never achieve, it is nevertheless something we should strive for: we must be ambitious in order to come as close to perfection as possible. Get into the flow: the inner drive for perfection leads to passion and dedication.The pursuit of meaningfulness: a fundamental intrinsic impetus.In old age, people begin to consider what was important in their lives and ask whether they achieved something. But Striving to change something in oneself and in society is a much healthier and satisfying impetus. For more and more people, such meaningful goals have become their main driving force. We are increasingly committing ourselves to voluntary and unpaid activities. The pursuit of meaningfulness: a fundamental intrinsic impetus.My task, my time, my team! Self-determination promotes intrinsic motivation. Regardless of whether we are scientists, cashiers or mechanics, we are far more dedicated to our work when allowed self-determination. Some people wish to have more of a say in their working hours, others in the way in which the team is composed. If an employee is allowed these freedoms, they develop a greater potential for achievement, are more contented in their job, and are less inclined to burn out. In short, self-determination contributes positively to motivation. My task, my time, my team! Self-determination promotes intrinsic motivation.The effective company: upgrading to 3.0.Intrinsic motivation 3.0 is no secret, and yet many businesses do not take advantage of the opportunities it offers. The motivation of workers in most companies continues to be based on extrinsic factors: to motivate them, rewards and bonuses are dangled before their noses like carrots before donkeys. The conservative management, through an if-then system of reward, generates passivity and lethargy. It has been proved that creative workers are at their most productive when intrinsically motivated, and high productivity benefits the whole company. Such a change can be achieved through small measures, such as unexpected attention: more than anything else, spontaneous praise and constructive feedback channels the focus of the workers on the joy of their work, and so their natural intrinsic motivation increases. Workers who are given a voice in the decision-making of their company become more intrinsically motivated. More importantly, if it is made clear how important each individual’s contribution is for the performance of the whole company, each person feels their actions to be meaningful, and hence they become more committed. The drive for perfection is satisfied through the balanced allocation of tasks: each employee is given a task at a level of difficulty that challenges their abilities and stimulates them without being too complicated and, hence, demotivating. In order to give employees the sense that they are working towards something communally beneficial, their work can be linked to donations and social involvement. So employees work with the good feeling that they are having a positive effect on others, and that they are fighting for a higher purpose. A management that is up to date on the forms of motivation will modify its rewards and promote self-determination, perfection and meaningful goals. As a result, the employees will demonstrate a higher commitment and more dedication, instead of simply serving their time in work without the ambition to achieve. The effective company: upgrading to 3.0.Final summaryThe key message in this book is: Rewards and sanctions are effective on a short-term basis as performance incentives. In the long run, however, they lead to harmful behavior and destroy the inner impetus. Passion and dedication on the part of workers are better achieved through self-determination, possibilities for perfection and meaningful goals. The following questions are answered in the book: What types of motivation are there, and how do they work? Motivation 1.0 and Motivation 2.0: basic needs and the stick and the carrot. There is another way: Motivation 3.0 – intrinsic motivation in place of exterior incentives. Missing the target: the stick and the carrot can have harmful consequences. How does intrinsic motivation work, and what influences it? Extrinsic promises destroy intrinsic motivation. Get into the flow: the inner drive for perfection leads to passion and dedication. The pursuit of meaningfulness: a fundamental inner impetus. How can intrinsic motivation be increased in everyday work? My task, my time, my team! Self-determination promotes intrinsic motivation. The effective company: upgrading to 3.0. Suggested further reading: A Whole New Mind by Daniel Pink In an age where computers and well-trained workers from low-paid countries are taking over even white-collar jobs, what can you do to stand out? As we move out of the Information Age and into a new Conceptual Age, the answer is to start embracing the aptitudes associated with the right side of your brain, which were previously thought of as less valuable than analytical left-brain skills. To find these blinks, press “I’m done” at the bottom of the screen.What’s in it for me? Learn how to embrace your failures to become successful.The world these days is a competitive place where success is the only currency that counts. Failure, which is usually considered the opposite of success, or even an obstacle on the road to it, is seen as a something to be avoided at all costs. But are our failures always such disasters? Not necessarily – and it may well be time to review our opinions about failure as a concept. Contrary to popular belief, failure actually isn’t the opposite of success, but rather a necessary part of it. Failure doesn’t need to be avoided. Instead, it should be embraced, because we can learn from it and become stronger in the future as a result. In these blinks, you will learn why failure can be a good thing. You will see why failure is an opportunity, what it can teach you and how you can overcome it. Learning to fail today will help you be successful tomorrow. You’ll also learn how a marketing debacle paved the way for Coca-Cola’s greatest success; how the experience of failure led Thomas Edison to develop the world’s first recording device; and why Peanuts cartoon character Charlie Brown shouldn’t be a role model. Failure can’t be avoided, so think of it as a critical part of moving forward.While most of us do our best to avoid failure, most entrepreneurs know better. The majority of successful businesspeople attribute their success to their ability to persevere after failures. In fact, it takes entrepreneurs an average of 3.8 failed ventures before they manage to start a successful business. These entrepreneurs recognize that even if their business eventually fails, they’ll be in a better position than they were when they started. But if their fear of failure had stopped them at the beginning, they wouldn’t have gotten anywhere. In the real world, a single failure doesn’t always mean the end of the road. Failure opens up new opportunities.While we largely assume failure can only lead to negative outcomes, the opposite is often true. Many chance discoveries and new opportunities have emerged from failures. This was certainly the case for legendary inventor Thomas Edison. Beyond opening our eyes to new possibilities, failure can be a powerful incentive to work hard and change our lives. You might not be to blame for your failures, but you are responsible for your successes.Most of the time, failures occur as a result of factors that we can’t control. When that happens, we don’t need to blame ourselves, we just need to take responsibility for finding new solutions. For another example, Turning failure into knowledge is instrumental to success.Could you imagine starting a new project and aiming to fail? Probably not; most of us prefer to avoid making mistakes. And yet, failure always has the potential to create instructive, even inspiring, learning experiences. It’s important to note that we only learn from failure when we’re determined to understand it. One strip from the comic Peanuts reflects on this phenomenon. Overcoming our fear of failure and taking new risks brings long-term success.When you drive across town, how often do you catch only green lights? Probably never, but that’s alright – it’s just a part of driving. How might life be if we saw our failures as red lights? They might stop us temporarily, but they aren’t a reason to give up on our destination. Failure can feel very discouraging, but this doesn’t have to be the case. Fear of failure is debilitating and can damage our chances of achieving success, so it’s crucial that we fight it at every opportunity. We can also take heart in the fact that we overcome our fear of failure in countless daily activities. Driving a car, for instance, is a dangerous activity, but we do it anyway. In fact, choosing to cycle or stay at home out of fear of having a car crash might even put you at greater risk: a total of 15 and 17 percent of accidents resulting in injuries are linked to cycling and home-based activities, respectively. Our professional lives also provide opportunities to overcome our fear of failure and act. Suggesting a daring strategy or proposing to take on more responsibility are great ways to confront your fear of failure and earn the respect of your team, too. Refusing to take risks, on the other hand, is more likely to leave your team members feeling like you’re, at best, unambitious, and at worst, lazy. Taking risks inevitably leads to failure some of the time, but by embracing this, you’ll be more likely to win big in the long run.To make the most of opportunities for success, you need clear goals, social skills and a positive mindset.Learning to embrace and overcome failure opens up new opportunities for success. But to be able to use these opportunities, you’ll need to practice three things: goal-setting, people skills and a positive mindset. American writer Don Marquis noted that while most people don’t truly know what they want, they’re still willing to sweat blood to get it. The trick to success is channeling this desire for change into well-defined objectives. So, rather than simply complaining that you’re tired of working, set goals that’ll allow you to create a better lifestyle. For example, you could invest in property to create a passive income that’ll allow you to retire sooner. Along with goal-setting, outstanding people skills can carry you to success. Today, most jobs, projects and goals can only be achieved by mobilizing stakeholders, investors, teams and employees. By spending time working on your communication, negotiation and conversational skills, you’ll be better able to win the support of your peers and open up new opportunities for achieving your ambitions. Finally, maintaining a positive mindset gives you an immediate advantage. Learning to see the value in even the most trying of experiences can be the difference between giving up and persevering. Final summaryThe key message in this book: Failure is inevitable, but it can also be beneficial. From revealing new ideas and pushing us to become our best, to helping us learn about our weaknesses, experiences of failure provide us with valuable opportunities. Along with clear goal-setting and a positive mindset, embracing failure is key to unlocking success. Actionable Advice Seek out stories of failure that inspire you. Is there an entrepreneur, leader or dreamer that inspires you, from the past or present? Though their successes might be what makes them a role model to you, try spending some time researching their lives to find out more about their failed ideas as well. Not only will this give you a deeper understanding of their successes, their missteps might also offer an inspiring lesson or two. Got feedback?

Suggested further reading: The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership by John C. Maxwell The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership (1998) explains what it takes to become a great leader. These blinks highlight many of the traits, skills and characteristics that have given leaders around the world the power to attract loyal followers and lead them toward success. Find out what Ray Kroc, Winston Churchill and Mother Theresa all have in common – and what you can do to become a better leader yourself. What’s in it for me? Learn the simple rules for being more popular and persuasive.Since How to Win Friends & Influence People was published in 1936, it has sold over 15 million copies. The advice contained within these blinks is deceptively simple, but remains as effective as ever. Just adhering to simple guidelines like smiling when meeting someone and remembering their first name can help anyone become more likeable and influential. In these blinks you’ll learn why Theodore Roosevelt was so popular among his staff; why being critical almost forced Abraham Lincoln into a sabre duel; and what everyone’s favorite conversation topic is. If you want to make a good first impression, smile.It is our actions, not our words, that show others what we think of them. Thus, when we meet someone new, the easiest way to say “I like you and am very happy to meet you” is to smile. We humans are suckers for people who smile at us. If we meet someone new and see them smile, we tend to automatically like them as well. The smile of a baby, for example, immediately makes us feel warm and fuzzy inside, as does seeing a dog wag his tail like crazy because he’s so happy to see us. If you want to make yourself instantly likeable, the first thing to do is to show others how much you enjoy being around them. If you’re happy to see someone, the other person will be happy to see you too. Psychologists have also uncovered a positive side-effect of excessive smiling. It seems that the connection between positive emotions and smiling is not a one-way street; consciously smiling can lead to positive emotions, just as positive emotions can lead to (involuntary) smiling. This means that by smiling, we not only make other people happier, but ourselves as well. Hence it can be said that while a smile costs nothing, it brings a lot of joy for everyone involved.If you want others to like you, don’t criticize them.Criticizing people and pointing out their mistakes doesn’t encourage them to change their behavior, and it certainly doesn’t help them learn anything. This is because people are not primarily driven by reason but rather by emotion. Even when criticism seems warranted, it usually won’t have the intended effect. The person you criticize won’t really listen to what you’re saying, because they will feel attacked and their natural reaction will be to immediately defend their own position by fighting back. Hence, criticizing someone might help you blow off steam, but in the long-term it will only make others like you less. Criticizing someone is easy, but it takes character to be understanding and to forgive others for their mistakes and shortcomings. If you want others to like you, try to understand what drives them, accept their shortcomings, and make it a rule to never criticize them openly, for this criticism will only come back to harm you.If you want others to gladly do you favors, show your appreciation frequently.How can you get someone to do you a favor? You must ensure they want to do it. And how is that possible? You must motivate the other person with a simple reward: your sincere appreciation. One of the strongest drivers of human behavior is the desire to be appreciated by others. We all like being complimented and hearing we’re doing a good job. Some people even claim that all of civilization ultimately rests upon the human desire for appreciation. Our desire for approval and praise makes us climb the highest mountains, write novels and found multimillion-dollar companies. So what can we learn from this? The possibility of receiving praise as a reward is a much stronger incentive than the threat of punishment for a bad job. For someone to want to do you favors, they must know you as someone who shows appreciation, not someone who is quick to criticize. To show your appreciation and make yourself someone people enjoy working with, use simple phrases such as “Thank you” or “I’m sorry,” and learn to give sincere praise. Don’t shower people with phony flattery, or they will see through it and it won’t work. Your appreciation must be honest. To attain this honesty, the right mindset is crucial. Try thinking like Ralph Waldo Emerson, who said that every person he met was superior to him in certain ways, so there was always something to learn from and appreciate in other people. If you take others seriously and treat them with respect, you will find it easy to value their work and show them honest and sincere appreciation – and in turn they will like you and enjoy working with you.If you want to be interesting yourself, be interested in others.We all love a good listener, especially when that person encourages us to speak about ourselves. All humans are naturally interested in themselves, and hence we’re always happy to meet someone who shares this interest. So if you want to appear likeable and interesting, don’t talk but listen. Ask others about themselves and encourage them to speak as much as they like. The secret of being interesting is simply to be interested. To really listen means giving the other person your full attention. Make a conscious effort to show that you’re genuinely interested in learning about everything they have to say. Don’t interrupt them or let yourself be distracted. Sigmund Freud was famous for his listening skills. He excelled at showing others how very interesting he found everything they said, and in return they felt completely comfortable talking to him and would reveal even their most private emotions and experiences to him. On the other hand, talking about yourself excessively, failing to listen to others, and constantly interrupting them when they are speaking will make others dislike you instantly. If you only talk about yourself, it indicates you are self-centered and care only for yourself, making you thoroughly unlikeable to others. Therefore, to be more likeable, try to be a good listener and encourage others to talk, especially about themselves.Show your appreciation for others by talking about what’s important to them.People enjoy talking to good listeners, but even more than this they enjoy talking to someone who is knowledgeable about things they’re interested in, such as their jobs or their hobbies. Everyone likes to talk about things that are important to them, so naturally they like other people who share their interests. Take Theodore Roosevelt, for example. Of course, there is one topic everybody is interested in: themselves. Every person feels that they are valuable and interesting, and we enjoy others confirming this belief. Benjamin Disraeli was certainly right when he said, “Talk to people about themselves, and they will listen for hours.” Dale Carnegie, for example, once wanted to brighten the day of a bored service employee, so he told him, “I certainly wish I had your head of hair.” The easiest way to get into the mind-set of appreciating others is to keep in mind the Golden Rule: treat others as you would like others to treat you.We like people who show their appreciation and remember things about us, like our names.How do dogs manage to win the affections of people within just seconds of meeting them? The answer is simple: unconditional love. A dog is always interested in you, and shows its interest enthusiastically. People respond to this behavior, because we appreciate it when we are shown affection. It promotes our self-esteem and makes us happy. So what is the lesson we can apply to our daily interactions? If you want to win others over, show them your full appreciation and be enthusiastic about it. Demonstrate that you’re interested in them and in what they have to say, and try to remember the things they tell you. In practice, this means you should always greet others cheerfully, be a good listener, and make sure you remember personal details like names and birthdays. This demands a bit of effort – for example, you may need to take notes after every encounter with a person – but it will pay off in the long run. The simplest trick for generating affection is to remember and frequently use another person’s name, since everyone likes to hear their own name. Whenever you meet someone new, remember their name and try to use it as you talk. The other person will like you instantly. Avoid all arguments – they cannot be won.Think about it: What’s the point of arguing with others? Nine times out of ten, once the battle is over, both parties will be even more determined in their stance than they were before. There is nothing to gain from such arguments. No matter what the result, your opponent won’t agree with you. Rather, they will just resent you and your arguments. Therefore, the only solution is to avoid such disputes from the start. When you encounter opposition to your ideas, there’s often no need to find an agreement. It’s already valuable to have others challenge your views, without imposing your own ideas on them. Be thankful for their input, and think about their reasoning, instead of automatically arguing to bolster your views. If two people always agree on everything, then one of them is dispensable. Nevertheless, if two people constantly argue and yell at each other, there can be no real discussion. Hence, avoid arguments, but when they are absolutely necessary and inevitable, keep your emotions out of them. Initially, both parties should maintain a distance to each other so they can first think about the topic in private. They should only meet in person once the initial emotional reaction has dissipated.Never tell others they are wrong; they will only resent you.Whenever you tell someone they’re wrong, you’re basically saying, “I’m smarter than you.” This is a direct attack on their self-esteem. Their feelings will be hurt, and they will want to retaliate. In general, whenever you want to express your opposition to someone’s opinions, never say things in absolute terms like “It is clear that…” or “Obviously, the case is…,” since this implies “I’m smarter than you.” Even if you do think you’re smarter, never openly display this mentality to other people. To get the other person to reevaluate their view, it’s much more effective to be humble and open-minded; for example, “I thought differently but I might be wrong. I’ve been wrong pretty often, so let’s have a look at the facts again together.” If you frame your opposition like this, the other person is much less likely to become upset or to resent you before even hearing what you have to say. With a little luck, a soft approach will quickly turn opponents into allies, making it possible for you to change their opinions. Whenever you are wrong, admit it immediately and clearly.We all make mistakes. Whenever you do and someone is about to berate you for it, there’s a simple way to steal your opponents’ thunder: admit your mistake quickly and clearly. This can have an unexpected effect: just a second ago, the other person was planning to bolster his own self-esteem by criticizing you, but the moment you admitted your “guilt,” the situation completely turned around. If the other person still wants to feel important, they must be generous and forgive you. This approach also has another very positive side-effect: publicly criticizing yourself is much more pleasant than having to listen to others do it. Public self-criticism is also likely to make others think more highly of you. Anyone can defend themselves in the face of criticism, but it takes character to openly admit your weaknesses and shortcomings.To be convincing, get others to say “yes” as often as possible.If you want to persuade someone to change their opinion, never let them know this is what you mean to do. No one likes having to change their opinion; hence, you must persuade them indirectly. First of all, try to win the other person over by being nice, polite and patient with them. If you act aggressively and combatively, your opponent will stop listening and will feel the need to fight back and defend their position. To avoid this, always emphasize shared interests. Make it clear that both you and your opponent have the same goals. Never reveal your own views before ensuring the other person believes your interests are shared. Once the other person sees your goals as converging, the most effective way to persuade them of your views is to make them agree with you as often as possible. Build your argumentation by asking your opponent lots of small questions that can only be answered with a “yes.” The reasoning behind this approach, also known as the Socratic method, is simple: the more yeses you get during a discussion, the greater the probability that you will also get a “yes” when you finally reveal your real position on the subject. By using the Socratic method, you can even get people to agree with views they would have fiercely opposed only moments before.Final summaryThe key message in this book: Make sure others like you by smiling, listening and showing your appreciation for them. This will make them more inclined to listen to you and do you favors. Actionable Advice: Smile! The next time you meet someone new, make a conscious effort to smile at them as you’re shaking hands. This greatly increases the chances you’ll make a good first impression, and as everyone knows, first impressions count for a lot. Suggested further reading: Influence by Robert B. Cialdini Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion explains in detail the fundamental principles of persuasion that get us to say yes, including how they are used against us by compliance professionals like salesmen, advertisers and con artists. Knowing these principles will allow you both to become a skilled persuader yourself and to defend yourself against manipulation attempts. To find these blinks, press “I’m done” at the bottom of the screen. What’s in it for me? Get an inside look at what made Sir Alex Ferguson’s teams so great.When you can’t stop winning, eventually people will want to know your secrets. And when one of the greatest soccer managers of all time starts talking about what made his teams great, you want to hear it. Enter Sir Alex Ferguson, who won dozens of trophies with Manchester United during his 27 years in charge, who led teams that slayed clubs across England and Europe, and who has come to symbolize what it means to be a winner. His teams could play with flair and style or unsmiling discipline. They were comprised of pretty boys and hard workers alike. But, no matter who they were or what their playing style, they just about always seemed to win. How? Why? What made them so good? Obviously it didn’t hurt to have world-class players like David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney on board. But, even as players came and went over the years, Ferguson kept on winning. These blinks go into his leadership secrets and what he believes ensures top-level performance. In these blinks, you’ll find out why your presence alone is such a powerful motivational tool; what makes Cristiano Ronaldo so great; and how to set the right expectations for your team. Coaches must constantly listen and observe.We’ve got two ears and two eyes – but just one mouth. Is it a coincidence, or should we be listening and observing twice as much as we talk? The truth is that listening always pays off. It is a great opportunity to learn new and useful things – coach Alex Ferguson can attest to this. Ferguson knows the value of listening and knows it well. Just by listening, he picked up some tips and tricks that have served him for a lifetime. For example, Still, focusing on the details can be helpful, too. As the saying goes: know your enemy. Success is not possible without discipline and determination.Most of us assume that the world’s best soccer players are simply gifted from birth with skills we should never dream of having. But is that really the key to their success? Not quite. There are a lot of talented soccer players out there, which means a lot of competition. If you want to stay in the game, you need to sustain yourself. This is why discipline is so instrumental in achieving success. Great managers (and coaches!) think several steps ahead to lead players on their journey to success.Like discipline and determination, preparation is another key factor ensuring top athletic performance. But it’s not just players that have to think ahead – sporting organizations do, too. Fostering young talent is a long-term project. Balance your players' strengths and weaknesses, and stay down-to-earth. Of course, creative players are what makes a team’s attacking side so thrilling. Think of players that can overwhelm the opponent’s defense or make a sudden unbelievable sprint down the field like Cristiano Ronaldo. But a team wouldn’t survive if it didn’t have the right amount of steady, reliable defenders, too! Presence and praise are powerful tools to get the best out of your players.Whether it’s that great high school basketball coach you had or an inspiring activist, the best leaders have a special something that inspires their teams. So what’s it made of? Secondly, great leaders know that support is more effective than criticism when change is needed. Ferguson always provided criticism to help players improve their technical skills, but did so tactfully. For instance, he’d always wait until players had calmed down after a game, rather than criticizing them immediately afterwards. And, he always presented his criticism as a form of encouragement, letting players know that he believed they were capable of better performance. Finally, good leaders are understanding. Final summaryThe key message in this book: Great coaches are always observing, seeking out new ways to understand and overcome challenges their players face. By encouraging discipline and determination, and taking on calculated preparation, coaches can give players their shot at success. Top performance is maintained by keeping the team balanced and supporting players with presence and praise. Actionable advice: Deal with failure and don’t be a quitter!When you do fail, take responsibility for your failures without blaming others. Instead, figure out what you did wrong and learn from it. This is why, in general, team members that are winners take great pride and look forward to avenging defeats. Don’t forget, it’s useless to get lost in self pity. Got feedback?

Overcome grief through resilience and joy. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to overcome the three Ps; the dangers of the mum effect; and why your grieving loved ones need a panic button. Trauma often leads to coping with “the three Ps.”If you’ve been confronted with personal tragedy or any traumatic and life-changing event, it can dramatically alter your outlook. Psychologist Martin Seligman has identified three common responses to tragedy, which he calls the three Ps. The first one is personalization – blaming yourself for the tragedy. The Another common reaction, and the second of the three Ps, is pervasiveness – when the pain and sadness reaches every part of your life. This brings us to permanence – feeling like the pain is going to last forever. This can be the most difficult P to overcome because when we feel depressed, it’s easy to think that the load is so immense, we’ll never be able to shake it. But in the next blink, we’ll start to see just how we can move on.Nurturing resilience is the key to resuming a joyous life.The three Ps can make you feel like you’re walking around with a lead blanket draped over your body, which is how one of Sandberg’s friends described her grief. But even though it can feel like there’s no escape, there is a way out. And the first step to getting yourself on that path is to find resilience. No one lives a life without loss or suffering. People you might characterize as always being happy still go through ups and downs. They’re just resilient and can see the good that’s still there when times are tough.Learning to take back joy helps you go on.One of the tricky parts of dealing with grief is allowing yourself to be happy. After suffering a loss, you may have caught yourself enjoying a laugh and then felt ashamed about it. But there’s no need to. When we add this kind of remorse to the grieving process, it only makes it harder to find resilience. Another common form of shame for those who’ve lost someone is survivor’s remorse, and asking yourself, “Why did my loved one die and not me?” This guilt isn’t limited to death, either. You might experience it after surviving a round of mass layoffs at your workplace. Or you might feel gratitude for being spared, which can lead to shame for being happy when your coworkers are out of a job. When coping with a death, you might find comfort in thinking about what your loved one would have wanted. Surely they’d want you to be happy, rather than feeling guilty that you’re still alive. Spending time with others who are coping can help the healing process.Perhaps you’ve heard This is, of course, an extreme example, but it can provide a helpful perspective on just how resilient humans can be, especially when they’re part of a group that has shared the same experience. This is why support groups can be of great help in the grieving process; they’ll not only be understanding of what you’re going through, but they can also help motivate you to reach goals.Don’t be afraid to acknowledge the pain of others.Have you known someone who’s lost a loved one, or gone through some other trauma, and felt the desire to avoid talking to them or spend time with them until they were done grieving? It’s a common feeling, and you may even convince yourself that you’re doing them a favor by giving them space, but silence and isolation won’t help their resilience. Psychologists have a name for the kind of friend who avoids bringing up painful topics and acts like everything's fine: they’re a non-questioning friend who’s practicing the mum-effect. While these friends don’t mean any harm, their actions can lead to the grieving person feeling more alone than usual. You can ease the stress of those in need by offering specific help. This is something you can provide by acting like that panic button for those you care about. It’s also best to offer specific help, and to not just say, “Let me know if you need anything.” This is a common phrase, but it doesn’t make it any easier for the person to ask for help. Most people don’t want to seem like trouble, so they’ll usually avoid asking for anything at all. But when you offer something specific, like helping them buy groceries or look for a new home, they’ll recognize your offer as genuine and coming from someone who cares.Final summaryThe key message in this book: Loss is difficult, but the key to bouncing back in the face of trauma and tragedy is to nurture your resilience and allow yourself to rediscover your sense of joy and hope. This can mean drawing support from groups and friends and not relying on your own strength alone. If it’s not you, but someone you know who is going through a tough time, don’t assume they need time to themselves. Instead, make sure to acknowledge their pain and reach out with specific things you can help them with. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Suggested further reading: Lean In by Sheryl Sandberg Through a combination of entertaining anecdotes, solid data and practical advice, Lean In examines the prevalence of and reasons for gender inequality both at home and at work. It encourages women to lean into their careers by seizing opportunities and aspiring to leadership positions, as well calling on both men and women to acknowledge and remedy the current gender inequalities.What’s in it for me? Discover the history, secrets and inner workings of power.As a child, entering primary school can be a bit of a shock. If you were raised by conscientious parents and believed everything they told you about honesty and fairness, chances are there was a steep learning curve ahead of you when lumped in with your new classmates. Suddenly it became clear that fairness is for suckers and wimps! The reality is, always trying to be fair can seriously hamper your success. Of course, if you’re a top-level business manager or politician, you already knew that. But there is hope even if you’re not. Robert Greene was once just like you, but decided to look deep into the history and machinations of power to learn all about how to gain it, use it and defend against abuse of it. He came up with a whopping 48 laws of power, and these blinks will focus on the seven most illuminating ones. In these blinks, you’ll learn how a beginner’s mistake can help you win a chess tournament; why a minister was thrown into a dungeon for throwing a party for his king; and how, sometimes, your best chance of winning a battle is to surrender. Flaunting your brilliance won’t win you your boss’s favor, but making him or her shine will.Have you ever tried to impress your boss, only to fall flat on your face? Well, if you’ve ever failed to impress someone in a position of power, it could actually be the result of outshining them. After all, powerful people want to be the center of attention; trying too hard to impress them can shift attention away from them and onto you, hurting their pride in the process. But what’s even worse is acting superior to them, a move that could lead your boss to think of you as a threat to their position and, consequently, to let you go from the company. Take credit for other people’s work and be sure to protect your own.Would you ever consider claiming parts of another person’s work as your own by plagiarizing a few clever snippets? Did you ever slyly steal answers from a classmate during a math test? Maybe you did or maybe you didn’t, but the truth is that attaining power often means using the work of others to your advantage. If you don’t claim credit, someone else will jump in, steal your idea and all the credit that comes with it.Gaining power over somebody means getting to know them – and posing as their friend is the best way to do so.Maybe you’ve encountered this problem before: you’re striving to outmaneuver the competition but can’t quite manage to accurately predict your competitors’ strategies. How can you get around this? Well, another trick to gaining power is to gather important information about the people you want to control. And to get something from someone, you need to know about them. After all, knowing a person’s plans, weaknesses and desires will help you both win their favor and guide their actions. So how can you accomplish what Duveen did? You can hire informants or, even better, act as a spy yourself by posing as a person’s friend. While most people opt for hired spies like Duveen did, this strategy is risky. After all, how can you be sure that your spies are being honest with you? To be sure your information is accurate, it’s best to do the spying yourself. This is no easy task, as people generally hesitate to share private information with strangers. However, they’re not as secretive when in the company of someone they consider a friend, which makes posing as a companion a highly effective strategy.Act unpredictably to confuse the competition.You probably know that most people don’t like sudden changes, but did you know that you can use unpredictability to your competitive advantage? Acting unpredictably can keep your competition off balance, and here’s how: In competitive scenarios, your opponents will likely try hard to figure you out by monitoring your habits and decision making, and they won’t hesitate to use this information against you. In this situation, your best move is to act erratically – being unpredictable will protect you from being understood by your opponents, which will intimidate and unnerve them. Surrendering to a stronger opponent will help you gather power down the line.Have you ever gone up against someone knowing that you’d never win? While it’s common for people to fight for glory against all odds, it’s not the route to power. So what should you do when faced with an opponent more powerful than you? Give up. This may seem an odd strategy, especially since humans instinctively fight their enemies to protect themselves. But when a competitor acts with aggression, he will expect you to respond in the same way. In cases when you know that the competition has you beat, your best move is to do just the opposite and surrender. Why? If you give up, or at least convince your enemy that you’ve done so, you can ensure that he won’t deliver substantial damage. Not only that, but your opponent, thinking he has won, will also let down his guard. When he does, you’ll have a golden opportunity to regain your strength and plan your next move. Build long-term strength instead of making major sacrifices for short-lived bouts of glory.If you want to be treated like a superior, you’ve got to act like one.Are you higher up the ladder than someone else? If so, it’s essential to act the part – unless, of course, you prefer to be seen as their equal. But a word of warning: acting as if you’re equal to others while holding a superior position to them will only inspire contempt. Then what’s a better tactic? You should instead use the strategy of the crown to make people treat you like royalty. Simply put, To gain power over others, seduction works better than coercion. Final summaryThe key message in this book: The world has historically been ruled by power and conquest. Of course, much has changed in the modern era, but the importance of control and dominance has remained. By learning from the failures and victories of historical power struggles, you too can become a force to be reckoned with.

Attain the lifestyle you want, become more productive and automate your income stream.If you could have any life you wanted, where would you be right now? On a yacht somewhere in the Caribbean? Maybe scaling a Swiss mountain or whitewater rafting in Costa Rica? Whatever your dream is, these blinks will show you how to plot a roadmap there. You’ll find out how any corporate cubicle jockey can first become more productive, then cut back their working time and eventually break free from their day job entirely to pursue their dream. In these blinks you’ll learn why the “worst-case scenario” is almost never as bad as you think; how you can become an “expert” in anything; and why you should strive to read your emails only once a week. To the New Rich, being rich means living a splendid life, right here, right now.Lots of people think it’s worth their while to live a life of drudgery today just to have some golden, wealthy years of retirement somewhere in the distant future. Millions of modern desk slaves sacrifice their best years working in jobs they don’t enjoy. To maintain faith in what they are doing, they trick themselves into believing that work has to be hard and that they will be paid back at some point in the future. In reality, they end up deferring everything joyful in their lives only to wake up one day and realize that the good times never materialized. The New Rich do not accept this way of life: they abandon their desk-slave jobs and choose a lush lifestyle here and now. Becoming one of the New Rich doesn’t mean you need millions of dollars under your mattress; a fulfilling life is often much cheaper than people think. The things you’re dreaming of – such as taking trips around the world or having lots of time for hobbies – are by no means exclusive to millionaires. These things are also available to the New Rich, and they do not need millions to enjoy them. What you really need is to be mobile and flexible – you need to be able to do whatever you like whenever you like. This usually requires only a moderate, automatic income: a source of money you can maintain effortlessly from anywhere in the world. This is the key to living exactly the life you want to.Write your own rules, and always aim high.The New Rich never follow someone else’s rules unquestioningly. Instead they write their own, ignore conventional expectations, and are willing to step on people’s toes when necessary. Adopt this mindset and you, too, can aim high and accomplish even the biggest goals, the so-called “unrealistic” things such as travelling the world, becoming the world champion in tango dancing or learning a new language every year. Aiming high will set you apart from all those who think “realistically” and settle for mediocrity. In fact, since most people settle for good rather than aim for great, the competition for good goals is often far more fierce. “Unrealistic” things might be easier to accomplish than you think, because only a few dare to think big. It’s often lonely at the top, meaning less competition for you. While most people tend to overestimate the risks of dreaming big and aiming high, the New Rich try to understand what the worst-case outcome of any gutsy decision could be. For example, if you decided to travel the world right now, and everything went wrong, what is the worst that could happen? Intuitively, most people dread a journey into the unknown, but often this is simply because they never consider the true risks they are facing. When you take a critical look at the risks, you often find out that even the worst-case “catastrophe” is not the end of the world at all. For example, if you lose all your money and discover your journey isn’t going as expected, you can always cancel it and start something new. Adopt this mindset and you will find the calm that is helping the New Rich conquer the world.Take action today, and step outside your comfort zone.Instead of living their dreams, most people spend their lives running away from them. They take the safe road and live a life of drudgery, drawing comfort from the illusion that at least they will enjoy their retirement. If you want to join the New Rich, you have to stop lying to yourself. The right moment to start living your dreams is right now. Forget about the sentence, “I’ll do this tomorrow.” You need to start doing the right things today. To do this, you must be willing to cross the boundaries of your comfort zone. Staying within your comfort zone allows you to constantly lie to yourself so you can maintain a blind faith that everything is going to be good someday, somehow. This way of thinking is often mistakenly labeled as optimism, but in fact it’s mental laziness. It comes from a fear of the challenges you must face if you want to achieve your big goals in life. Face your fears. Do something that scares you every day. Living a successful life means always being willing to do unpleasant things, to have unpleasant conversations, and to disregard the conventions other people stick to. When you see an attractive stranger on the street who you would like to meet, don’t be like most people and feel too intimidated to even approach them. Why not just go ahead and start a conversation? What we fear doing the most is often exactly the thing we should do to turn our dreams into a reality. The most dangerous thing you can do is to do nothing and wait and see.Even as an employee, you can live the life of the New Rich.The life of the New Rich is mainly characterized by unlimited mobility. This means giving up the life of a desk slave. But not everyone feels they can take that step. The good news is that, even as an employee, you can travel the world. Just try to gain maximal freedom within the boundaries of a corporation. How do you achieve this? First of all, make yourself indispensable. Have your company invest money into you, attend trainings and become an expert they can’t afford to lose. The moment you’ve become indispensable, start selling your boss on the idea of remote work; that is, working from home or from anywhere else in the world. Try to keep the transition to remote work as smooth as possible, since most managers won’t like the idea at first. This can mean suggesting a test period to start with; for instance, you might suggest that you work remotely one day per week for just a couple of weeks, after which you meet with your boss to discuss how it went. During this test period, make sure you prove how much more productive you are while working from home. And you should be, because there are far fewer distractions at home than at the office. Since you don’t have to waste half your day commuting, chatting to colleagues or attending useless meetings, you should get much more done in the same amount of time. After successfully proving this to your boss, expand the amount of remote work step by step, until, one fine day, you don’t have to show up at the office ever again.Be effective, not efficient: don’t do everything right, do the right things.Time is not a good indicator of productivity. Spending a lot of time working does not mean you’re doing the right things or that you’re doing them in the right way. In today’s work-places, it’s hard to measure the productivity of a white-collar worker. Time spent at the office is the most obvious indicator, which is why it’s such a popular metric to use. However, employees need only to appear busy by filling their day with pointless tasks and spending as much time at the office as possible to trick their bosses into believing they are doing a great job. The New Rich, on the other hand, reject all the limitations and absurd rules of corporate jobs. To them, being productive means getting as much done as possible with as little work as possible. There’s no point being concerned with efficiency, which means getting things done as quickly as possible. Unimportant tasks are still unimportant even when you deal with them efficiently. Your time is better spent on important tasks – on being effective. Focus on only those tasks that will bring you closer to your personal goals and dreams. To focus on the important things, use the 80/20 rule: in most situations, 20 percent of the work produces 80 percent of the results. The rest of the work – most of what we do – usually has very little effect. Hence, make good use of your time by focusing on the tasks that have the greatest impact. If you get rid of everything else, you can spend the time you gain on important tasks, pleasant pastimes, or both.Time is money: get rid of time-thieves and go on a low-information diet.Most of the things people do during a regular workday have no impact whatsoever; hence, getting rid of them doesn’t decrease the quality of your work but does save time. For example, And make sure you get this information in the most efficient way. Don’t spend hours researching a topic when instead you can call on an expert to answer even complex questions quickly. This saves time and often provides better results. During an average workday, you’ll likely encounter many time-thieves: activities or people that use up your precious time while giving very little in return. Get rid of them. Meetings, for example, are like black holes where time and energy disappear, and most are completely unnecessary anyway. In fact, the only time a meeting is appropriate is when a decision calls for input from several people. If this is the case, make sure there is an agenda and a fixed schedule to keep participants focused on results and to stop them from babbling. Never attend meetings where you’re not absolutely indispensable. If the meeting is “successful” without you, then apparently you can skip future meetings as well. Get rid of distractions like emails, and have others play by your rules.To the New Rich, being productive means achieving a lot with as little work as possible. This means focusing on things that bring you closer to your personal goals. If you want to know how important a task is, ask yourself, “If this was the only thing I did today, would I be happy with this day?” Whenever your answer is “yes,” make that task a priority, and ensure high-priority tasks get done before any others. In an ideal work-day, you will accomplish all your important goals before lunch. Never start your day by checking emails. Emails are time-thieves, so give them as little attention as possible. If you have to check them, do so only twice a day: once before lunch, and once in the evening. Then move to reading them only once per week. Make your new policy known: create an auto response that tells people your time is too limited and valuable to spend checking emails all day and therefore your response may take some time. Make sure people don’t start calling you over every minor question they have, thus constantly interrupting your concentration. Most things can wait. Have people leave you messages via email or recorded voicemails, which you will check once your more important tasks are done. Only urgent things should be an excuse for interrupting you. This also means you can bundle tasks. Set aside a fixed period of time to deal with all the small tasks that have accumulated on your to-do list rather than allowing them to interrupt you constantly while you are working on something important.Set up a business that brings a steady stream of income and works without you.If you want to earn a living while only working a few hours per week, you need an automatic source of income. This means you have to make other people work for you and get them to invest their time instead of you having to invest yours. Today, it’s fairly easy to set up a business that can run without much involvement from you. Decide what work is required for the business to operate smoothly, divide it up according to type, and find an expert to manage each area. Today, most things can be outsourced. There are many companies that specialize in manufacturing products, shipping them, or doing after-sales service, among many other things. Even complex and ever-changing tasks can be outsourced. Virtual assistants from India, for instance, are often cheap yet highly professional. Such a personal assistant can do nearly everything you would usually do yourself. As long as the task and its goal are crystal-clear, they will get it done without your help. By setting up a business in which every task is outsourced to an expert, you can make your involvement almost completely unnecessary. To achieve this, keep two things in mind: First, everyone has to be able to communicate with one another without you as an intermediary. Don’t make yourself a bottleneck in any part of the process! Second, delegate responsibilities. People can solve most problems without your help, if you just let them. You’d be surprised at how smart people are once you ask them to take over certain responsibilities and make their own decisions.Find a product and test whether there’s a market for it.To create an automated income, the first thing you need is a product. One option is to simply re-sell a product that already exists in the marketplace. This is fairly easy, but the potential profits may be quite limited. Hence, it often pays to create your own product. This is much easier than most people think. It usually takes only a few brainstorming sessions to come up with a plethora of ideas. Before you choose a product and start manufacturing it, you need to know whether your potential customer base is large enough to make it successful. Having a product is not enough; you need customers too. Like him, you should never start selling a product without first testing whether there are customers for it.Be a professional: act like one, and be picky about your customers.No matter what kind of product you want to sell, you must be credible in the eyes of your customers. They have to trust you in order to trust your product. Also, Overall, you should aim at being a solid professional: always act like one and use high standards when choosing your customers. The 80/20 rule applies to customers as well as to productivity: 20 percent of the customers are often responsible for 80 percent of the revenue, and likewise another 20 percent are responsible for 80 percent of the trouble, complaints and stress you endure. Find out which of your customers are responsible for your revenues and attend to them; meanwhile, get rid of the customers that account for little revenue but create a lot of trouble.Go premium, make a big promise, and keep it.Once you’ve found the right product, you still have to think about several other aspects of your automatic income generator. To sell your product, you must be able to promise your customers big benefits from using it, and you must keep this promise. Only when you’re able to summarize these benefits in one simple sentence should you start selling it. Finding profitable customers often means choosing a premium segment. Ask for a premium price and create a premium image so that you can earn greater margins and thus build a more profitable business. The higher the profit on your products, the fewer you need to sell to meet your income goals, and hence the fewer customers you'll need to deal with. Also, the people willing to pay a higher price are often those who are the least likely to cause trouble, complain or return your products. If they buy premium, they probably don’t have to watch every penny, so even if a product doesn’t meet their expectations they probably won’t bother returning it. You can even risk offering these customers a full refund plus extra compensation if they want to return your product. If you pick the right customers, they won’t take unfair advantage of this offer; rather, they will trust you and your product even more.Final summaryThe key message in this book: Instead of living the nine-to-five life of a desk slave, join the New Rich, create an automated income and enjoy a full life here and now. Actionable Advice: Ideally, you’ll have all your crucial tasks done by lunch, and the rest of the day will be just gravy.

Filled with many personal anecdotes from a 12-year span of job-hopping, Quitter shows you the smartest way to quit your day job for your dream job. To find these blinks, press “I’m done” at the bottom of the screen. What’s in it for me? Adopt the habits that distinguish highly effective people from the herd.Why do some people seem so adept at leading successful and fulfilling lives while others struggle with failure and a lack of meaning? Simple: the former group has adopted seven key habits that make them highly effective at dealing with life, work and the world around them. In these blinks, you’ll learn about all seven of these habits: Sharpen the saw: Don’t work yourself to death. Strive for a sustainable lifestyle that affords you time to recuperate and recharge. If you really want to change, you need to work from the inside out. Only once you’ve drastically changed yourself can you start to change the world around you. If, for example, you would like to have a happy marriage, you must first become a more positive person yourself. To stay physically fit, you need to take regular exercise, eat healthily and avoid undue stress. To stay mentally healthy, you should, as far as possible, read plenty of good books, make time for your own writing in some form – be it letters or a diary – and actively plan your future according to your long-term goals. It is also important to take care of your social and emotional health by forming as many positive relationships as possible and never neglecting your social needs. Spiritual health also contributes greatly to lasting effectiveness: this can mean praying or meditating, but it can also mean regularly confronting your own norms and values and reflecting actively upon them. Most importantly, you should consciously make time to recuperate and recharge. An extreme example of true proactivity was Viktor Frankl, who was able to maintain control over his own feelings during his time in concentration camps, including Auschwitz. He simply decided that he was not going to allow his tormentors to control his innermost feelings. Many people, by contrast, are not proactive in life, but rather reactive. They react to external circumstances and their behavior and emotions are dependent on what goes on around them. Hence, for example, they can be in a good mood only if the weather is also good. People who are proactive, on the other hand, determine their own weather. Not knowing what’s really important to you and what you’re working towards is like climbing a ladder which is set against the wrong wall. To avoid this, it is important to first be clear about your long-term goals. To this end, it can be useful to ask yourself the Funeral Questions: What do I want people to say about me at my funeral?; As what sort of person do I want to be remembered?; For what do I want to be remembered? You should form as concrete a mental picture of what you’re about to do as possible: one which sets out exactly what should be achieved. You should visualize how you’re going to aim your bow so that you hit the bullseye. This kind of visual anticipation works in all possible situations. Most competitive sportsmen, for example, are well-practiced in visualizing how they will leave the starting block, complete a perfect stretchand finish in first place. The same principle is true for an office. First you need a clear mental picture, which can then be translated into concrete actions. The greater the balance, the greater trust exists between the parties. To this end, you should aim to make regular payments and withdraw money only rarely from the account. A payment can be, for example, finding a win-win solution, sticking to a promise you made, or really listening empathetically to the other person. A withdrawal, on the other hand, would be finding a win-lose solution, breaking a promise, or only half-listening to the other person. Once you have reached the maximum balance in your account, you should aim to understand the needs and mission statement of the other person, and to invest also in these. That's why, in everyday life, it is vitally important to always keep promises, and to be courteous and sensitive even in small matters while, above all, remaining loyal. If it happens that you make a withdrawal from the account one time, you should apologize sincerely. People are more than happy to forgive a repentant sinner. Plucking up the courage to admit you were wrong is therefore always worthwhile. How much would we trust a doctor who very quickly gave a diagnosis without having really listened to us at all? How helpful would it be for an optician to merely hand us his own glasses, claiming that since he can see fine with them, they should work for us too? Though most of us might be critical of such behavior, we actually behave very similarly in everyday life, particularly in conversation with others. We don’t really listen, and instead formulate our response extremely quickly. We tend to project ourselves onto the other person and look for solutions we can "prescribe" for them. A mantra is a simple, frequently repeated statement that reminds the employees why the company exists. For example, Nike’s mantra is “Authentic athletic performance” and Disney’s is “Fun family entertainment.” You may think that a company’s mission statement already performs the same function, but a mantra is different in that it is shorter, more direct and more memorable. For example, Coca-Cola’s mission statement is “The Coca-Cola Company exists to benefit and refresh everyone it touches.” That’s a mouthful. But if we formulate a hypothetical mantra for the same company, we could come up with something like “Refresh the world,” which is much catchier and easier to keep in mind. Your positioning should also be formulated so that it speaks specifically to your target group of customers. For example, let’s say your company sells security software for banks. Which one of the following two positioning statements would you rather go with: “Increasing the security of websites,” or “Reducing the risk of online-transaction fraud for commercial banks”? Clearly, the latter is far more effective at speaking to the target customer. A second factor in successful positioning is that it should feel personally relevant to the individual customer. For example, if you’ve invented an innovative new kind of sunblock, you shouldn’t be saying, “Can reduce global cancer rates by up to three percent,” but instead, “Prevents you from getting melanoma.” If you’re an expert in audio technology, you might proudly proclaim: “Our hearing aids use digital signal processing,” but this won’t mean anything to an audience of investors. To avoid this communication gap, when preparing your pitch always ask yourself “So what?” after everything you want to say. Then prepare to answer that “so what” using a few clarifying, vivid examples. So again, if you want to say: “Our hearing aids use digital signal processing,” ask yourself “So what?” Your response could be: “Because our hearing aids make sounds clearer.” Then use a real life example to really make the matter crystal clear: “So if you’re at a party with a lot of ambient noise, you’ll still be able to hear your conversation partner perfectly.” This is a benefit anyone can understand. Only accept partnerships that will positively affect your financial forecast. This means your partner has to enable you to, for example, reduce costs, accelerate product development or enter a new market. In other words, the benefit has to be tangible. For example, in its early days, Apple partnered with the Aldus Corporation, which had produced a desktop publishing program called PageMaker. Apple needed a “killer application” that would run on its computers, whereas Aldus needed a channel through which to sell its software. As a result of the partnership, both companies flourished. Contagious products are cool. The iPod, for example, was successful partly because it was the first cool Mp3 player. Second, contagious products are effective, or excellent at what they do. The TiVo, for example, became an iconic digital video recorder because it allowed you to record your favorite TV shows so effortlessly. If it had been a pain to use, no one would ever have even heard of it. Third, contagious products are distinctive, or noticeably different from the competition. Consider the Hummer, for example – you wouldn’t confuse it with any other car. To create a recognizable brand. You also need to build a community of users around them. These communities provide support to users and make the experience of using the product or service a more satisfying one. For example, Coca-Cola’s loyal fans started a Facebook fan page that gained over one million followers. You may never have heard of it, but once upon a time, a company called Univac led the computing market. But the company made a crucial error of judgment: it saw its computers as sophisticated tools to be used by scientists only, and therefore only produced machines suitable for complicated scientific calculations. At this time, however, another company realized that businesses were also interested in the potential of computing, and so it began building machines targeted at this new consumer market. Though the name Univac is long forgotten, you may have heard of this second company. It’s IBM. So what’s the lesson? Always keep an open mind and look for non-obvious customers and uses for your products. To begin the process of validated learning, you must come up with hypotheses about whether and how certain products will be successful in a given market. For example, “US customers will be willing to purchase shoes online.” Such fundamental hypotheses have to be tested, and only if they are validated by talking to customers can the start-up know it’s on the right track toward finding a sustainable business model. Don’t use questionnaires or fictional customers though; instead, talk to real customers in a realistic environment. The most reliable way to find out whether people will buy your product is to offer it to them and see how they respond. Take the success story of Zappos: it started with the simple hypothesis that people would be willing to buy shoes online. To test this idea, the company took photographs of shoes in shoe stores and displayed the photographs in a fake web shop. When people actually tried to buy the shoes online, Zappos saw that their hypothesis was valid. Through this approach, the foundation was laid for one of the most successful business models of the last decade. Take a look at Facebook: they managed to validate both the value and growth hypothesis at a very early stage when the social network had only a few users. First of all, the registered users were very active in the network. More than half logged in at least once a day – impressive proof for the value hypothesis. Second, Facebook had sensational user-activation rates, meaning it gained market penetration very quickly. In colleges where Facebook had been introduced, three quarters of all students signed up within one month – without the company having spent a penny on marketing. Thus, the growth hypothesis was proven as well. Such impressive data made investors strong believers in the future success of this new social network, leading them to invest millions at a very early stage. Take the founders of Dropbox. They knew that developing their idea into a product would take a lot of time, so they chose a simple and creative way to validate their hypothesis that there was demand for a new and user-friendly data-synchronising service: they created a video presenting their idea. The founders had assumed there was a demand for such a product, and they were right: within one night, 75,000 people had signed up to their waiting list, and the Dropbox team concluded they were on the right track. Thus, they could confidently start developing the actual product. A clever way of distinguishing between value and waste is split-testing. Whenever you consider adding a feature or changing an existing one, create two versions of your product: one with the new feature and one without it. By testing both versions, you’ll soon see which one is more appealing to customers. The first companies that used this technique were mail-order businesses. For example, to find out whether a new catalogue layout would increase orders, they printed two versions of it: 50 percent of their customers got the old design, and 50 percent got a new one. The catalogues were identical in every other way and the customers were split randomly, so the companies simply had to compare how many orders were placed by each group. This data answered the question of whether the new design was an improvement or not. Many start-ups had to pivot a couple of times before finally becoming successful businesses. Take Groupon: they started as a platform for activism and fundraising, and only later turned into the daily deals platform they’re known as today. Imagine these two scenarios for example: In the first scenario, you’re given $1,000 and then must choose between receiving a definite $500 or taking a 50 percent chance to win another $1,000. In the second scenario, you’re given $2,000 and must then choose between a sure loss of $500 or taking a 50 percent chance on losing $1,000. If we made purely rational choices, then we would make the same choice in both cases. But this isn’t the case. In the first instance, most people choose to take the sure bet, while in the second case, most people take a gamble. Prospect theory helps to explain why this is the case. It highlights at least two reasons why we don’t always act rationally. Both of them feature our loss aversion — the fact that we fear losses more than we value gains. The first reason is that we value things based on reference points. Starting with $1,000 or $2,000 in the two scenarios changes whether we’re willing to gamble, because the starting point affects how we value our position. The reference point in the first scenario is $1,000 and $2,000 in the second, which means ending up at $1,500 feels like a win in the first, but a distasteful loss in the second. Even though our reasoning here is clearly irrational, we understand value as much by our starting point as by the actual objective value. Yale professor Frank Zhang examined a stock market crash on May 6, 2010 that lasted just 18 minutes but resulted in losses of trillions of dollars. He found that the rapid pace of trading had drastically increased the volatility of the market, leading to extreme swings in the value of financial products.
