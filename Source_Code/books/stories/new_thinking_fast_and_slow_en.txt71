To test the market, offer your hypothetical product to real customers. One way to do this is to create a fake web store that does everything a real web store would do except that after people click “Purchase,” a message tells them the product is currently out of stock. This will show you how many people are willing to buy your product. Make sure you collect the email addresses of these hypothetical customers though, so you can tell them once your product is actually available.
