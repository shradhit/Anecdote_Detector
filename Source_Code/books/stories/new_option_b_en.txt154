Being resilient is about understanding that pain is a part of life and that suffering and loss aren’t things that can be avoided. It’s also important that we recognize and appreciate the good along with the bad. One way to do this, and to help get through those tough times, is to keep a daily record of your emotional state. Sheryl Sandberg kept her journal by her bed, and every night she wrote down three moments of happiness from her day, which was enough to alleviate her emotional state. She also began to keep a note of her accomplishments – even the smallest ones, like getting to work on time, doing the laundry or just making a good cup of coffee. While it might seem meaningless, recognizing events like these will help shift your attention away from the negative and remind you that positive experiences are still possible, even when you’re grieving.
