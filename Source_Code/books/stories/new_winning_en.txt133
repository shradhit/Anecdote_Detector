What moves people during the course of their lives and why do they act as they do? To answer this question, psychologists investigated the quest for meaning in the lives of young people. They asked graduates of the University of Rochester about their main aim in life. While some named extrinsic profit targets and wanted to become rich and famous, others specified more meaningful intrinsic goals: to develop personally and to help others, for example by working for international aid organizations. Some years later, the researchers interviewed the same participants to find out how things had turned out for them. The students with profit goals were no more contented, even having successfully achieved positions as managers in large firms. On the contrary, they suffered from depression and anxiety more frequently than the students who had stated meaningful goals. The latter reported to have achieved a greater happiness in life with their goals, and only rarely suffered from psychological ailments.
