Charlie Brown is building a sand castle at the beach, which gets flattened by a wave. He looks down at the sand castle and knows there’s something to be learned from the situation – but he doesn’t attempt to figure out what the lesson is. Like Charlie Brown, in the wake of failure many people tell themselves that they don’t have the time or energy to investigate what went wrong. But this simply puts us at risk of making the same mistake again. Identifying the causes of failure allows us to learn, grow and, in Charlie Brown’s case, build sand castles farther away from the waves.
