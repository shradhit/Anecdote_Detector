Sheryl was especially hurt by people who would ask her, “Hey, how’s it going?” Because she knew they just expected her to respond with the usual, “Good thanks, how are you?” The simplest way to make a difference is to ask, “How are you today?” This acknowledges that the person is still going through a difficult period and that some days are better than others. This is a simple, kind way to express empathy. When Sheryl heard this small difference in the question, it helped her to open up, be honest and process the grief. She was also happy on the occasions when someone offered her one of the best signs of compassion: a hug.
