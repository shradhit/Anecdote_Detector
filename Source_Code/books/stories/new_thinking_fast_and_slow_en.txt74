People tend to trust larger companies more than they trust small ones. Hence, always try to make your company appear bigger than it is. Whether it’s true or not, give people the impression they are dealing with a company with many employees. For instance, provide several contact email addresses on your website. Use titles that sound like middle-management such as “head of customer support” to give the impression there’s a multi-layer hierarchy with lots of employees in the company.
