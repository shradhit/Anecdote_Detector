If you’re an expert in audio technology, you might proudly proclaim: “Our hearing aids use digital signal processing,” but this won’t mean anything to an audience of investors. When preparing your pitch always ask yourself “So what?” after everything you want to say. Then prepare to answer that “so what” using a few clarifying, vivid examples. So again, if you want to say: “Our hearing aids use digital signal processing,” ask yourself “So what?” Your response could be: “Because our hearing aids make sounds clearer.” Then use a real life example to really make the matter crystal clear: “So if you’re at a party with a lot of ambient noise, you’ll still be able to hear your conversation partner perfectly.” This is a benefit anyone can understand.
