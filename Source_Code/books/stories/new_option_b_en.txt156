The famous story of the Uruguayan soccer team that crashed in the Andes mountains in 1972 is a remarkable example of resilience as 16 of the 33 crash survivors were able to endure deadly freezing conditions. Resilience isn’t just found  within individuals, but also among individuals who can gain strength together. Over an agonizing 72 days, the survivors faced starvation, avalanches, frostbite and having to eat the frozen flesh of their dead teammates and loved ones in order to survive. What’s even more shocking is that they managed to keep hope alive even when they heard through their broken radio – which could receive, but not send, messages – that their search party had been called off. One way of generating hope was through sharing their dreams for what they’d do once they got back to civilization, such as starting a restaurant or a farm and spending time with their loved ones.But hope needs to be combined with what psychologists call grounded hope, which happens when action is taken to make things better in the immediate future. The survivors did this by sending teams to find supplies and locate shelter, which resulted in a series of small but gradual improvements. First, they found the tail-end of the crashed plane, which provided a roof of sorts and insulation that could be turned into sleeping bags. This, in turn, kept them warm at night and allowed them to go on longer expeditions, eventually hiking 30 treacherous miles over ten days to find a local man on horseback, resulting in their rescue.
