In another experiment, participants were asked to find a way to fasten a candle to a wall, a puzzle whose solution necessitated creative thinking. Here, too, some participants were promised money for solving the problem quickly. Instead of inspiring these participants to think creatively, the prospect of this reward clouded their thinking and blunted their resourcefulness. The incentive seemed to blinker them, impeding the wider vision necessary to solve the task, and resulting in notably longer completion times when compared to participants who were not promised a reward.
