As a child of the Great Depression, young Warren learned the value of money. In 1932, when the Depression hit Warren’s hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, his father lost his job as a securities salesman for a local bank. But his dad was resourceful and soon began his own company, selling safe and reliable stocks and bonds. Earnings were meager. Indeed, they could afford so little food that Warren’s mother would often give her portion to Howard so that he would have a decent meal. These difficult times left a lasting impression on Warren Buffett, and fueled his desire for the kind of security and stability that money can buy.
