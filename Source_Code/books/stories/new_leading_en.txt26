Finally, in 1961, Buffett took the next big step and purchased controlling interest in a company. It was the largest investment he’d made so far – a full million dollars of his partnership’s money, which he put into Dempster Mill Manufacturing, a struggling windmill company that most other investors wouldn’t go near. But Buffett knew it had solid intrinsic value, and his investment had made him chairman of the board for the company. He went to work sorting out their troubled finances. A year later, the company was on the path to profit, with $2 million worth of stock being traded at twice the price of what Buffett had initially paid. By 1963, that price was at three times its initial value and it was time for Buffett to move on, so he sold the company and earned his partners a $2.3 million profit.
