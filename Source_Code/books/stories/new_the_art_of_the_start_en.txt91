Take the case of Bertolt Brecht, a writer of revolutionary, communist ideas who immigrated to the United States in 1941 to join other intellectuals exiled from Europe. After World War II, Brecht and his peers were summoned before the US Congress, which was investigating a supposed communist infiltration of Hollywood. While his fellow radicals caused a commotion and challenged the authority of Congress by yelling and being uncooperative, Brecht was calm and politely answered the questions he was asked. Because of his good behavior, Brecht was released by the government, which even offered to help him with his immigration procedure â€“ in the end, their offer was irrelevant because he left the country and continued writing about his firm beliefs. And his stubborn friends? They were blacklisted, unable to publish for years!So, do as Brecht did and make surrender a tool of self-empowerment.
