How much would we trust a doctor who very quickly gave a diagnosis without having really listened to us at all? How helpful would it be for an optician to merely hand us his own glasses, claiming that since he can see fine with them, they should work for us too? Though most of us might be critical of such behavior, we actually behave very similarly in everyday life, particularly in conversation with others. We donâ€™t really listen, and instead formulate our response extremely quickly. We tend to project ourselves onto the other person and look for solutions we can "prescribe" for them.
