Take a look at Facebook: they managed to validate both the value and growth hypothesis at a very early stage when the social network had only a few users. First of all, the registered users were very active in the network. More than half logged in at least once a day – impressive proof for the value hypothesis. Second, Facebook had sensational user-activation rates, meaning it gained market penetration very quickly. In colleges where Facebook had been introduced, three quarters of all students signed up within one month – without the company having spent a penny on marketing. Thus, the growth hypothesis was proven as well. Such impressive data made investors strong believers in the future success of this new social network, leading them to invest millions at a very early stage.
