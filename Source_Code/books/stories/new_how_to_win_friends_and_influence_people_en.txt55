Research done by Kathleen Vohs proves that the concept of money primes individualistic actions. People primed with the idea of money - for example, through being exposed to images of money - act more independently and are less willing to be involved with, depend on or accept demands from others. One implication of Vohsâ€™s research is that living in a society filled with triggers that prime money could nudge our behavior away from altruism.
