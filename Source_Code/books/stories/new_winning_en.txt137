Another example is Zappos. A typical call-center has an annual staff turnover of 35 percent, because making telephone calls for hours on end is not just boring but also stressful â€“ it offers little room for self-determination and hence provides no intrinsic motivation. Zappos, however, does things differently: the employees are allowed to work from home with no managerial pressure, and can lead conversations in their own style. They are highly motivated, thus remaining with the company longer, and their customer service is also notably better than average.
