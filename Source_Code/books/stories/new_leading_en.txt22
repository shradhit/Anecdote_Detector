Buffett always looked forward to visiting his fatherâ€™s office, and, when Warren was ten, Howard took him on an exciting business trip to New York, where they visited the Stock Exchange. A year later, when he was eleven, Warren made his first profit by buying and selling stocks along with his sister, Doris. To afford these stocks, Warren had undertaken many entrepreneurial activities, such as roaming the local golf course to collect lost golf balls and then selling them back to the owner.
