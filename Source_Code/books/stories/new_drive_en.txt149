While most people believe they’re not influential enough to bring about such widespread change, and therefore don’t even try to do so, the truth is that the decisions which are the key to changing your own life are also the key to transforming society. For example, what might seem like a trivial life decision: choosing what to eat for dinner. Let’s say you’ve decided, for personal health reasons, to cut beef out of your diet. Although it may seem that this change will benefit only yourself, the fact is that stopping eating beef could make a difference on a much larger scale. For instance, to produce 250 pounds of beef requires as many acres of land as that needed to grow 40,000 pounds of potatoes. In other words, we could get greater use out of the land we currently use for raising cattle, thus greatly diminishing the problem of widespread hunger. Your decision to cut out beef contributes to a reduction in the demand for that product, and thus towards the possibility of using that land for better purposes.
