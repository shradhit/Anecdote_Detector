GE no longer compares performance to budgets at all but rather to the prior yearâ€™s performance and to that of competitors. Thus, even seemingly great results might not merit praise if the year has been easy and competitors have fared even better. Conversely, even if a division performed very poorly, it may be excused if its competitors did even worse.
