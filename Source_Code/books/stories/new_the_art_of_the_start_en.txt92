Take Louis-Philippe, king of France during the 1830s and 40s. He despised royal ceremonies, as well as all the symbols associated with the throne. In defiance of the formalities of his position, he was infamous for wearing a gray hat and holding an umbrella in place of his crown and scepter. In fact, he didn’t even keep the company of royalty, mostly befriending bankers instead. But the king’s behavior didn’t do him any good – he was soon hated by both the rich and the poor. Wealthy people disapproved of the unlikely king, while the poor disliked a king who acted like the lower classes but didn’t look out for them. Even his banker friends turned on him when they found they could insult him without the fear of being reprimanded. All of this hatred mounted until the people rose up against him and he was forced to abdicate the throne. In general, people are suspicious of higher-ups who act like their equals; doing so leads people to thinking you’re dishonest, as they’ll assume your modest ways are a sly trick to cloud your privileges.
