Once a tennis player sees that his opponent is serving the ball, he has approximately 300 milliseconds to make a move. Skilled players are different can and will wait up to 200 milliseconds, taking in as much visual information as possible, before hitting the ball. Tennis is a great example of the human capacity for preconscious preparatory skills. A player has just enough time to pause, letting his unconscious mind formulate the best response but not enough time to consciously plan a move. Split-second timing plays an essential role in business and finance, too.
