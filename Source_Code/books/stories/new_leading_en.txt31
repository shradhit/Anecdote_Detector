Since his late 20s, Buffett has struggled to figure out what to do with his riches, since he doesnâ€™t live a glamorous lifestyle with expensive cars, homes or clothing. Nor does he want his children to rely on his success. Instead, he has always taught them to forge their own paths in life and earn their own livings. So, in 2006, after his wife Susan passed away, he finally decided that he would donate most of it to charity. One sixth of his fortune has been divided among different Buffett family foundations, and the rest will be allocated over time to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which helps fight disease in developing nations.
