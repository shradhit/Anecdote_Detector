Imagine you meet someone named Ben at a party, and you find him easy to talk to. Later, someone asks if you know anybody who might want to contribute to their charity. You think of Ben, even though the only thing you know about him is that he is easy to talk to.You liked one aspect of Benâ€™s character, and so you assumed you would like everything else about him. We often approve or disapprove of a person even when we know little about them.
