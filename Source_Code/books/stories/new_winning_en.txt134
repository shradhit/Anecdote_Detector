To have a larger goal in mind is more motivating and activating than money could ever be. Instead of striving for the highest possible profit, people who pursue meaning in their lives want to give something back to society â€“ which, in turn, also gives them personal strength. The results of further studies support this: the welfare of workers improves in companies where a proportion of the budget can be donated to charitable causes. And doctors are noticeably less drained if they are able to use one day per week to talk with their patients and do outreach service.
