One great rule of thumb when it comes to managing a team is avoiding extremes. Take Ferguson’s approach to the age of his team members. He didn’t want to have only young and inexperienced members, but also didn’t want only older, slightly less fit players. An equal mix of both was the best solution. Ferguson was also careful to ensure his team had a balanced amount of creative players and dependable players.
