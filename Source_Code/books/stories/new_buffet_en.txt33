Early on, the high-frequency trading firm UNX saw its profits rise when it increased the speed of its transactions. To further boost profits, the firm moved its headquarters from California to New York, reducing the distance electronic transactions would have to travel. In doing so, UNX cut transaction times from 65 milliseconds to 30 milliseconds. Suddenly the company’s profits started dropping. Unable to figure out why, the firm decided to return transaction speeds to the slower pace of 65 milliseconds. And as a result, profits also returned to positive levels. When trading happens too fast, traders can get caught in wide price swings, potentially leading to serious losses. Knowing this, financial experts are constantly seeking that “sweet” speed to optimize high-frequency trades that provides just enough delay for a trader to avoid expensive mistakes.
