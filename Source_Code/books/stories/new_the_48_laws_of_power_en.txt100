You should form as concrete a mental picture of what you’re about to do as possible: one which sets out exactly what should be achieved. You should visualize how you’re going to aim your bow so that you hit the bullseye. This kind of visual anticipation works in all possible situations. Most competitive sportsmen, for example, are well-practiced in visualizing how they will leave the starting block, complete a perfect stretchand finish in first place. The same principle is true for an office. First you need a clear mental picture, which can then be translated into concrete actions.
