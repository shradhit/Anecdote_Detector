Mistakes, controversies and integrity violations are inevitable and often spin out of control into full-blown crises. For example, one of GEâ€™s sales managers was caught bribing a general in the Israeli Air Force, which embroiled GE in a huge scandal. Another time, GE was accused of defrauding the US government by filing inaccurate timecards at a plant that made missile cones. Navigate crises in such a way that your company emerges from them stronger than ever.
