Picture yourself as Chuko Liang, head strategist for the ancient Chinese state of Shu. War has just been declared on China by King Menghuo from the south and stopping him and saving the country lies in your hands. But before learning what you should do, it’s essential to know what not to do. First of all, using force and coercive tactics is never wise, even when they’re the easiest choice. In fact, if you do exercise your strength, people will secretly resent you because force breeds resistance. Liang knew this and didn’t attack with force, even though he probably would have defeated the invading army. However, if he had, Menghuo would have resented both China and Liang and the country would have to continuously protect itself. This would have exhausted everyone involved and bred paranoia. A better strategy is seduction. People tend to be controlled by their emotions, and by playing on their feelings, you can make them do what you want – of their own free will. When Menghuo attacked China, Liang captured him and his entire army. Menghuo was separated from his soldiers and expected the worst, but to his great surprise he was offered delicious food and wine instead. While Liang released his enemy’s soldiers, he would only let Menghuo go when the enemy king promised that if he was ever captured again, he would bow to the Chinese king. And while Liang captured Menghuo several more times, he always let him go. Then, on the seventh capture, Menghuo dropped to Liang’s feet, surrendering himself and his kingdom. Even though Liang could have killed Menghuo when he captured him, a fact that the enemy king was aware of, he gave him plenty of chances and treated him well each time. As a result, Menghuo grew increasingly grateful and indebted to the Chinese king, until he finally surrendered of his own volition.
