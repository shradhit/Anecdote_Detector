Klein performed another study in which paramedics and medical students watched videos of six people performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The participants didn’t know that only one of the six people in the videos was an actual paramedic. When asked which person they’d trust most to resuscitate them in an emergency, 90 percent of the paramedics instinctively chose the most qualified person, the paramedic. Yet just 30 percent of the students were able to identify the professional from the rest.
