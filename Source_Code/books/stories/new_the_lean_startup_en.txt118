Starting something new in business, whether launching a new product or entering a new market, is very exciting; but for any new venture to succeed, you need to give it lots of love and special treatment. Put your smartest and most passionate people on the new business and grant them a lot of freedom and autonomy. Make a big hoopla about them, give them plenty of resources and act as their cheerleader every chance you have.
