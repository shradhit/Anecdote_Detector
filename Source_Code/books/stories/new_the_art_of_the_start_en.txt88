Why would you waste your energy doing things for yourself if somebody else can do them for you? For instance, did you know that the Serbian scientist Nikola Tesla worked for the famous inventor Thomas Edison? And it was actually Tesla, not Edison, who was key in creating Edison’s famed dynamo by improving what was at the time Edison’s rather primitive design. To make this discovery, Tesla worked tirelessly for an entire year, often clocking 18-hour days in the lab. But today, it’s Edison’s name that is attributed to the dynamo. But reaping the benefits of work done by others isn’t enough – you’ll also need to take credit for it. For example, Edison and his company claimed all the credit for Tesla’s work on the dynamo. Edison didn’t so much as share a penny of his profits with Tesla, even though he had promised him $50,000! So, keeping Tesla’s experience in mind, remember that the credit given for an invention or creation of any kind is just as essential as the invention itself.
