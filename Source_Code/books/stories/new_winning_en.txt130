Intrinsic motivation is gradually lost as a person is confronted with a world in which everything relies on extrinsic motivation – as illustrated in a nursery experiment in which children were asked to produce a drawing. Some children were promised a certificate for completing their drawing, and the others were not. When both groups were set to drawing again (this time with neither group being promised a reward), the children who had previously received a certificate no longer wanted to draw, whereas those who hadn’t received any special recognition did. The promised recognition had destroyed their intrinsic motivation: they had learned to draw only for a reward. Following this pattern, so-called if-then rewards gradually eradicate intrinsic motivation for many activities.
