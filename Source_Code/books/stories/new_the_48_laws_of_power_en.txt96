To stay physically fit, you need to take regular exercise, eat healthily and avoid undue stress. To stay mentally healthy, you should, as far as possible, read plenty of good books, make time for your own writing in some form – be it letters or a diary – and actively plan your future according to your long-term goals. Take care of your social and emotional health by forming as many positive relationships as possible and never neglecting your social needs. Spiritual health also contributes greatly to lasting effectiveness: this can mean praying or meditating, but it can also mean regularly confronting your own norms and values and reflecting actively upon them. Most importantly, you should consciously make time to recuperate and recharge.
