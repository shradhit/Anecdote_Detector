If you really want to help someone who’s grieving, acknowledging their situation is a great first step, but there are other simple steps to take. One of the best is to let them know that you’re there to help. In a way, this is like offering someone a panic button, which has been proven to reduce anxiety. In 1971, there was a classic experiment on urban stress by social psychologists David C. Glass and Jerome Singer. They asked participants to solve puzzles and perform focused tasks while frequently bombarding them with loud noises and music. As a result, many signs of stress, such as high blood pressure and heart rate were recorded. However, some participants were given a panic button that they could press at any time to stop the noise. Surprisingly, none of the participants actually used the button, but those who had the option stayed calmer and made fewer mistakes. It proved that we don’t need silence to be calm and endure stress, but rather, the knowledge that help is within our reach.
