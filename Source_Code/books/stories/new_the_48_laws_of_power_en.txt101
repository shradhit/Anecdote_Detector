The greater the balance, the greater trust exists between the parties. To this end, you should aim to make regular payments and withdraw money only rarely from the account. A payment can be, for example, finding a win-win solution, sticking to a promise you made, or really listening empathetically to the other person. A withdrawal, on the other hand, would be finding a win-lose solution, breaking a promise, or only half-listening to the other person. Once you have reached the maximum balance in your account, you should aim to understand the needs and mission statement of the other person, and to invest also in these. That's why, in everyday life, it is vitally important to always keep promises, and to be courteous and sensitive even in small matters while, above all, remaining loyal. If it happens that you make a withdrawal from the account one time, you should apologize sincerely. People are more than happy to forgive a repentant sinner. Plucking up the courage to admit you were wrong is therefore always worthwhile.
